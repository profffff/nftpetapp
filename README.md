# NFTPET App

Demo: https://nftpet.netlify.app/

It's a small personal project-game where the main goal is to raise a pet (aka Tamagotchi), with the reward being the opportunity to mint an NFT. The token can be used as a character in the game.

A self-made collection of NFTs, strikingly reminiscent of Pok√©mons.

## How to play
To get a reward (NFT), you need to poke 15 times on the correct buttons and the pet's mood should be good (8) or better. Incorrect actions lead to a decrease in mood.  
Stages:   
0 dead  
1-2 angry   
3-4 sad   
5-6 neutral  
7-8 good  
9-10 happy  
P.S. The supply of NFTs available is limited to 1500, and may run out. Have fun!
